# EZRAEL
**Studio Della Fonte, Xylotrip**

There are not many DJs who know how to keep a crowd on their feet for several hours straight. Our Ezrael does. He combines excellent crowd reading with a deep knowledge in music. He serves house music to the fullest by mixing disco and house classics [...]. 

As a producer, Ezrael is operating under different aliases and had several popular releases, one of them being a remix for Mr. Raoul Kâ€™s *O Mera Dil*. Apart from that he produces (depending on his persona) a broad range of music such as break and techno beats as well as ghetto house and deep house. Since 2020, Ezrael is founding father and proud member of the label *Studio Della Fonte*. In June 2021, he released his first album [...]. 

Ezrael is an absolute peak time performer with a huge local fan base who is also very keen to play legendary closings. His own event series such as *STRAAT 264* and *Xylotrip* in Nuremberg are well known for their selected bookings, among them [...]. It is always a pleasure to work with kind and humble Ezrael. We sincerely love him for his creative output as well as positive mindset. A true jack of all trades in the best sense.
